# r.functions
Some functions I commonly use for projects in R

## table.one.R

`TableOne()` is a function that takes a data.table input and creates a "Table 1"-style output data.table that can be an input table for `kableExtra` tables. 

- plan to rework missing data values to be an additional row for each variable rather than its own column

This is a line I am adding.
